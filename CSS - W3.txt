Why Use CSS?

CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.

Example Code:

body {
  background-color: lightblue;
}

h1 {
  color: white;
  text-align: center;
}

p {
  font-family: verdana;
  font-size: 20px;
}

CSS Saves a Lot of Work!

The CSS definitions are normally saved in an external .css file.
With an external stylesheet file, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!
